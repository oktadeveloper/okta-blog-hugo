When you start developing applications as a single developer or in small teams, your projects tend to be a single artifact. It contains domain logic, user interfaces, database access and other resources that must be in place if you want to put something online.

_"If it is useful, it will be modified"_ a QA Teacher of mine told me once to explain every software evolves when they are useful to someone: people will ask you for new features, bug fixes and changes in domain logic. As your project grows, soon or later you will face the monolith hell: the project is so big it is difficult to be maintained, and it's hard for anyone new to get into the project.

[Microservice architecture](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) (MA) is a pattern that tries to solve this problem: briefly, you logically divide your application into several apps so they are easier to be maintained, scale, can use different stacks, and different teams can work in parallel without usual conflicts.

On the other hand, MA lead us to a series of architectural challenges that must be addressed: how those services communicate? How to handle communication failures and availability? How to _trace_ user's requests between services? And, our focus on this article: how to handle user's authorization to access a single service?

## The Resource Server

In [OAuth 2.0](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/the-resource-server/), a resource server is a service designed to handle _domain-logic_ requests and does not have any kind of login workflow or complex authentication mechanism: it receives a pre-obtained access token that guarantees a user have grant permission to access the server and delivers the expected response.

In this article, you are going to build a simple _Resource Server_ with Spring Boot and Okta to demonstrate how easy it is.

In this tutorial, you will to implement a simple _Resource Server_ that will receive and validate a _JWT Token_.

## First things first

This example uses Okta to handle all authentication process. You can register for a [free-forever developer account](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) that will enable you to create as many user and applications you need!

I have set up some things so we can get started easily. Please, clone the following resource repository and go to `startup` tag, as follows:

```bash
> git clone -b startup https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-secure-spring-rest-api-example spring-rest-api
> cd spring-rest-api
```

This project has the following structure:

```bash
$ tree .

14 directories, 9 files
```

I created it using the excellent [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) and adding `Web` and `Security` dependencies. Spring Initializr provides an easy way to create a new [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) service with some common _auto-discovered_ dependencies. It also adds the [Maven Wrapper](https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper): so you use the command `mvnw` instead of `mvn`, the tool will detect if you have the designated Maven version and, if not, it will download and run the specified command.


**Fun fact**: Did you know the Maven wrapper was originally created by Okta's own [Brian Demers](https://twitter.com/briandemers)?! 

The file `HelloWorldController` is a simple `@RestController` that outputs "Hello World".

In a terminal, you can run the following command and see Spring Boot start:

```bash
> mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**TIP:** If this command doesn't work for you, try `./mvnw spring-boot:run` instead.
Once it finishes loading, you'll have a REST API ready and set to deliver to you a glorious _Hello World_ message!

```bash
> curl http://localhost:8080/
Hello World
```


**TIP:** The `curl` command is not available by default for Windows users. You can download it from  [here](https://curl.haxx.se/windows/).

Now, you need to properly create a protected _Resource Server_.

## Setting up a Resource Server

First, in Okta dashboard, create an application of type **Service** it indicates a resource server that does not have a login page or any way to obtain new tokens. 

<img src="/img/blog/secure-spring-rest-api/create-new-service.png" 
     alt="Create new Service" width="800" class="center-image">

Click **Next**, type the name of your service, then click **Done**. You will be presented with a screen similar to the one below. Copy and paste your  _Client ID_ and _Client Secret_ for later. They will be useful when you are configuring your application.

<img src="/img/blog/secure-spring-rest-api/service-created.png" 
     alt="Service Created" width="800" class="center-image">

Now, let's code something!

First, edit the `pom.xml` file and add the Spring Security and Okta dependency. They will enable all Spring AND Okta OAuth 2.0 goodness:

```xml
<!-- security - begin -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-oauth2</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.6.1</version>
</dependency>
<!-- security - end -->
```

By simply adding this dependency, your code is going to be like a locked house without a key. No one can access your API until you provide a key to your users! Run the command bellow again.

```bash
> mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Now, try to access the Hello World resource:

```bash
> curl http://localhost:8080/
{"timestamp":"2018-11-30T01:35:30.038+0000","status":401,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"Unauthorized","path":"/"}
```

Spring Boot has a lot of classpath magic and is able to discover _and_ automatically configure dependencies. Since you have added Spring Security, it automatically secured your resources. Now, you need to configure Spring Security so you can properly authenticate the requests.

> Note: if you are struggling, you can check the modifications in git branch `step-1-security-dependencies`.
For that, you need to modify `application.properties` as follows (use _client_id_ and _client_secret_ provided by Okta dashboard to your application):

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId=${client_id}
okta.oauth2.clientSecret=${client_secret}
okta.oauth2.scopes=openid
```

Spring Boot uses annotations and code for configuring your application so you do not need to edit super boring XML files. This means you can use the Java compiler to validate your configuration!

I usually create configuration in different classes, each one have its own purpose. Create the class `net.dovale.okta.secure_rest_api.SecurityConfig` as follows:

```java
package net.dovale.okta.secure_rest_api;

import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.oauth2.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableResourceServer;

@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableResourceServer
public class SecurityConfig  {}
````

Allow me to explain what the annotations here do:

* `@EnableWebSecurity` - tells spring we are going to use Spring Security to provide web security mechanisms
* `@EnableResourceServer` - convenient annotation that enables request authentication through OAuth 2.0 tokens. Normally, you would provide a `ResourceServerConfigurer` bean, but Okta's Spring Boot starter conveniently provides one for you.

That's it! Now you have a completely configured and secured REST API without any boilerplate!

Run Spring Boot again and check it with cURL.

```bash
> mvnw spring-boot:run
# in another shell
> curl http://localhost:8080/
{"error":"unauthorized","error_description":"Full authentication is required to access this resource"}
```

The message changed, but you still without access... why? Because now the server is waiting for an `authorization` _header_ with a valid token. In the next step, you'll create an access token and use it to access your API.

> Note: Check the git branch`step-2-security-configuration` if you have any doubt.

## Obtaining tokens

So... how do you obtain a token? A resource server has no responsibility to obtain valid credentials: it will only validate if the token is valid and proceed with the method execution.

An easy way to do this is to generate a token using the excellent [OpenID Connect \<debugger/>](https://oidcdebugger.com/).

First, you'll need to create a new _Web Application_ in Okta:

<img src="/img/blog/secure-spring-rest-api/create-new-web-application.png" 
     alt="New web application" width="800" class="center-image">

Set the _Login redirect URIs_ field to `https://oidcdebugger.com/debug` and _Grant Type Allowed_ to `Hybrid`. Now, on the OpenID Connect <debugger/> website, fill the form in like the picture below (do not forget to fill the client id for the recently created Okta web application):

<img src="/img/blog/secure-spring-rest-api/openid-connect.png" 
     alt="OpenID connect" width="800" class="center-image">

Submit the form to start the authentication process. You'll receive an Okta login form if you are not logged in or you'll see the screen below with the custom token for you.

<img src="/img/blog/secure-spring-rest-api/openid-connect-token.png" 
     alt="OpenID connect - getting token" width="800" class="center-image">

The token will be valid for one hour so you can do a lot of testing with your API. It is very simple to use the token, simply copy your token, and modify the curl command to use it as follows:

```bash
> export TOKEN=${FILL_YOUR_TOKEN}
> curl http://localhost:8080 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Hello World
```

## OAuth 2.0 Scopes

OAuth 2.0 scopes is a feature that let users decide if the application will be authorized to make something restricted. For example, you could have "read" and "write" scopes. If an application needs to _write_ scope, it should ask the user this specific scope. These can be automatically handled by Okta's authorization server.

As a resource server, it can have different endpoints with different scope for each one. Now, you are going to learn how to set different scopes and how to test it.

First, you need to add a new annotation to your `SecurityConfig` class:

```java
@EnableWebSecurity
@EnableResourceServer
@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)
public class SecurityConfig {}
```

The new `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)` annotation tells Spring to use [AOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming)-like method security and `prePostEnabled = true` will enable _pre_ and _post_ annotations. Those annotations will enable us to define security programmatically for each endpoint.

Now, make changes to `HelloWorldController.java` to create a _scope-protected_ endpoint:

```java
import org.springframework.security.access.prepost.PreAuthorize;
import java.security.Principal;
...
@PreAuthorize("#oauth2.hasScope('profile')")
@GetMapping("/protected/")
public String helloWorldProtected(Principal principal) {
    return "Hello VIP " + principal.getName();
}
```

Pay attention to `@PreAuthorize("#oauth2.hasScope('profile')")`. It says: before running this method, verify the request has authorization for the specified Scope. The `#oauth2` bit is added by [OAuth2SecurityExpressionMethods](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/oauth/apidocs/org/springframework/security/oauth2/provider/expression/OAuth2SecurityExpressionMethods.html) (check the other methods available) Spring class and is added to your classpath through the `spring-cloud-starter-oauth2` dependency.

OK! After a restart, your server will be ready! Make a new request to the endpoint using your current token:

```bash
> curl http://localhost:8080/protected/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
{"error":"access_denied","error_description":"Access is denied"}
```

Since your token does not have the desired scope, you'll  receive an `access is denied` message. To fix this, head back over to [OIDC Debugger](https://oidcdebugger.com/debug) and add the new scope.

![Profile Scope](openid_connect_profile_scope.png)


Try again using the newly obtained token:

```bash
> curl http://localhost:8080/protected/ -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
Hello VIP raphael@dovale.net
```

That's it! If you are in doubt of anything, check the latest repository branch `finished_sample`.

> Note: since `profile` is a common OAuth 2.0 scope, you don't need to change anything in your authorization server. Need to create a custom scope? See this [other article](/blog/2018/10/16/token-auth-for-java#add-a-custom-scope).
