In this tutorial, you are going to learn more about [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and how to integrate it with a [Spring Boot application](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

You will learn how to install a simple PostgreSQL instance using Docker and how to connect a Spring Boot application to it. After that, you'll create a simple database schema and add some data to it. Next, I'll show you how to create SQL files to deliver database changes, which are more suitable for enterprise applications. To finish, you will learn how to use PostgreSQL JSONB data structure and use PostgreSQL as a NoSQL database.

Let's dig into it!

## Relational Databases and PostgreSQL

Initially proposed in [the 70's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database), RDBMS (*Relational Database Management System*) has grown in popularity over the latest decades as the computing processing power and storage capacity increases. Other databases types such as [Graph Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database) or [Hierarchical Databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model) were introduced by the same time, but they were too complex by its time and helped Relational Databases to _win_ over them into developers preference.

Another critical characteristic of RDBMS systems is the support for [ACID transactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)) (*Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability*) which guarantee data consistency even in a concurrent environment without the developer need to be fully aware.

[PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) is one of the most famous RDBMS around. Technically speaking it is also one of the most advanced relational database system available (freely or commercial). Why is that? Postgres means *Post Ingres* or the successor of Ingres, an older database once sold and paved the way to the more famous *Microsoft SQL Server* and other products. What do they have in common? Its creator: Michael Stonebraker. If you are interested in history, Wikipedia has an [excellent article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) about it.

## Prerequisites

First and foremost, you'll need to clone this post's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-postgresql-spring-boot-example) that helps you if you have any doubts. Carefully selected branches are available to help you on each step of this article if you need any assistance.

You will also need PostgreSQL to run the tutorial. To install and test PostgreSQL, I recommend using Docker:

```bash
docker pull postgres:11
docker run --name dev-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:11
# CREATE db coursedb
docker exec dev-postgres psql -U postgres -c"CREATE DATABASE coursedb" postgres
```

The command above should run in any Linux, Windows, or MacOS distribution that has an instance of Docker installed. The first line pulls PostgreSQL version 11; the second line initiates a new instance of it with the name `dev-postgres,` running on port `5432`. The latest line executes a DDL command to create the database `coursedb` into the instance. Keep in mind you are not creating a volume for the storage data so once the container is deleted, all its data will be deleted as well.

Please, keep in mind you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) installed.

## Create Spring Boot App

**TIP:** If you'd like to skip this section, you can simply clone this post's repo and check out the `start` branch:

```
git clone -b start https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-postgresql-spring-boot-example.git
```

First, you need to create a new project with needed dependencies. Thankfully, Spring has the right tool for us: [Spring Initialzr](https://start.spring.io/).

<img src="/img/blog/postgresql-with-spring-boot/spring-initializr.png" 
     alt="New Spring Application" width="800" class="center-image">

Configure your project as the image above:

* **Project Type**: Maven Project
* **Group**: com.okta.developer
* **Artifact**: spring_boot_postgressql
* **Dependencies**: Web, JPA, PostgreSQL

Download the file and unzip it. Do you know you can already run this application? Simply run the command line below:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> **Note**: depending on your operating system, you need to change `./mvnw` to `mvnw` into the command line. 

Running `mvnw` will download Maven, all dependencies, and run the application goal (`spring-boot:run`). It will likely fail because you do not have a PostgreSQL database setup. Let's fix this.

## Add Database Configuration

**TIP:** Use `git checkout database_configuration` to skip this section.

You now have a system that has database dependencies but does not know where to connect. First, change your main class (probably `com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.SpringBootPostgressqlApplication`) and add the annotation `@EnableTransactionManagement` to it, like this:

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.EnableTransactionManagement;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class SpringBootPostgressqlApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootPostgressqlApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

Configuration annotations in Spring allow you to set up your application using _type safe_ code. This means if something becomes inconsistent with your configuration, it will show compilation errors. The feature is a nice evolution from the older XML-based configuration Spring used to have. Previously, it was possible to get runtime errors since XML and your code was not linked.

Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` to define your database connection properties:

```properties 
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://192.168.99.100:5432/coursedb
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=mysecretpassword
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
```

Here's a quick explanation of each property:

* `spring.datasource.url` - describes the JDBC connection URL. Each RDBMS (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc.) has its format. The IP `192.168.99.100` is the assigned by Docker to the host machine in Windows or MacOS machines. **If you are running on Linux or Mac**, you must change to `127.0.0.1` as the Docker Host is your machine.
* `spring.datasource.username` - the username you will connect to the database. You are going to use the master user for this tutorial. **For production, you should create a limited user for each application**.
* `spring.datasource.password` - The password you set when creating PostgreSQL docker instance.
* `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect` - Although SQL is a standard, each database has some specific syntax that is addressed by hibernate dialect.
* `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto` - Define if Hibernate can create, delete and create, update or validate the current Database Schema. Currently, you should set this property to `create` so Hibernate can handle all Database Schema.

What happens if you start up the application again?

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Now the application starts and you should be able to open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. Nothing nice happens as you haven't written any code for the UI yet. You may see an error stack on initialization: don't worry, it is simply Hibernate telling the JDBC driver does not support a feature (method `createClob`).

## Create Persistent Entities and DAO's

**TIP:** Use `git checkout entities` to skip this section.

OK, now let's do some real work.

First of all, let's look at this tutorial's schema. It has two entities:

* Teacher
  * Columns: name, picture, email
* Course
  * Columns: name, workload, rate
  * Relationship: teacher

Before changing the code, add two new dependencies in your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
    <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-rest</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Project Lombok adds a series of helpful features that simplify developer's life like getter/setter and constructor autogeneration. If you are using an IDE to develop this tutorial, you must install a [plugin](https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview) to avoid compilation problems.

Spring Data Rest is a handy dependency that creates an HTTP interface for your repositories. You are going to use the HTTP interface to test your code.

To help your entities, you'll create a _superclass_ that handles the primary key in the same way for every entity we create. PostgreSQL has support to UUID, so you are going to use it instead of the commonly used auto-increment integer. UUID is helpful to avoid a normal attack in which the hacker tries to increase or decrease an entity ID to discover new information.

Create the class `EntityWithUUID` in package `com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities`:

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities;

import org.hibernate.annotations.Type;

import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.MappedSuperclass;
import java.util.UUID;

@MappedSuperclass
public class EntityWithUUID {
    @Id @Type(type = "pg-uuid")
    private UUID id;

    public EntityWithUUID() {
        this.id = UUID.randomUUID();
    }
}
```

There are some excellent annotations here:

* `@MappedSuperclass` says to JPA this class is a superclass of an entity and should have its attributes mapped into the entity.
* `@Id` says the attribute is a primary key
* `@Type`  specifies what type is used on the database. You need to specify since PostgreSQL has its own type for UUIDs: `pg-uuid`.

Now, create the two entities in the `com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities` package:

**Teacher.java**
```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import javax.persistence.Entity;

@Entity
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Teacher extends EntityWithUUID {
    private String name;
    private String pictureURL;
    private String email;
}
```

**Course.java**

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import javax.persistence.*;

@Entity
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Course extends EntityWithUUID {

    private String name;
    private int workload;
    private short rate;
    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(foreignKey = @ForeignKey(name = "fk_course_teacher"))
    private Teacher teacher;
}
```

The annotations have a significant influence in these classes:

* `@Data` - It's a _Lombok_ annotation and tells Lombok to create getter and setter for all attributes.
* `@AllArgsConstructor` - Tells _Lombok_ to create a constructor with all class attributes
* `@NoArgsConstructor` - Tells _Lombok_ to create another constructor with no arguments. It is useful for JPA.
* `@Entity` - Indicates this class represents a persistent entity. It is interpreted as a table by JPA, and the table should have the same class name unless you change it.
* `@ManyToOne` and `@JoinColumn` - Indicates there is a _Many to One_ relationship whose relationship uses of a _Join Column_. It is possible to set the foreign key if Hibernate is going to create the DDL.

So far, so good. Now, create a DAO (_Data Access Object_, also called a _Repository_ by Spring) class for each entity in the `com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.dao` package:

**CourseDAO.java**
```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.dao;

import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Course;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import java.util.UUID;

public interface CourseDAO extends CrudRepository<Course, UUID> {}
```

**TeacherDAO.java**
```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.dao;

import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Teacher;
import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;
import java.util.UUID;

public interface TeacherDAO extends CrudRepository<Teacher, UUID> {}
```

You now have DAOs for each entity. You may be asking where is the implementation for them? Spring Data has some sweet and intelligent ways to handle this. Since your interfaces extend `CrudRepository`, Spring automatically generates the concrete class with all [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) related operations available!

To fill some data, create a new service class called `DataFillerService`. It will be responsible for inserting data in the database as soon as the application starts.

**DataFillerService.java**
```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.service;

import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.dao.CourseDAO;
import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.dao.TeacherDAO;
import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Course;
import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Teacher;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;
import javax.annotation.PostConstruct;

@Service
public class DataFillerService {
    private final CourseDAO courseDAO;
    private final TeacherDAO teacherDAO;
    public DataFillerService(CourseDAO courseDAO, TeacherDAO teacherDAO) {
        this.courseDAO = courseDAO;
        this.teacherDAO = teacherDAO;
    }
    @PostConstruct
    @Transactional
    public void fillData(){
        Teacher pj = new Teacher(
                "Professor Jirafales",
                "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Ruben2017.jpg/245px-Ruben2017.jpg",
                "jirafales@yahoo_.com"
        );
        Teacher px = new Teacher(
                "Professor X",
                "https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS9uI1Cb-nQ2uJOph4_t96KRvLSMjczAKnHLJYi1nqWXagvqWc4",
                "director@xproject_.com"

        );
        teacherDAO.save(pj);
        teacherDAO.save(px);
        // create courses
        Course mathematics = new Course("Mathematics", 20, (short) 10, pj);
        Course spanish = new Course("Spanish", 20, (short) 10, pj);
        Course dealingWithUnknown = new Course("Dealing with unknown", 10, (short) 100, pj);
        Course handlingYourMentalPower = new Course("Handling your mental power", 50, (short) 100, pj);
        Course introductionToPsychology = new Course("Introduction to psychology", 90, (short) 100, pj);
        courseDAO.save(mathematics);
        courseDAO.save(spanish);
        courseDAO.save(dealingWithUnknown);
        courseDAO.save(handlingYourMentalPower);
        courseDAO.save(introductionToPsychology);
    }
}
```

The method `fillData` is automatically called by Spring Context as soon the application context finishes loading. It uses the `@Transaction` annotations to indicate the entire method must run inside a transaction. That way, if any instruction fails, the entire method will be rolled back. As you can see, `CourseDAO` and `TeacherDAO` has some CRUD methods available.

Now, you can test if your application is working: 

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The application creates several REST endpoints to access your DAO's method. Try some commands: 

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/courses
curl http://localhost:8080/teachers
```

## Securing Spring Data Rest with OAuth 2.0

**TIP:** use `git checkout security` to skip this section.

You shouldn't expose your database structure without proper authentication. Let's solve this creating an [OAuth 2.0 Resource Server](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/the-resource-server/). A resource server is a service working in the infrastructure that has no login page, and it is used to server-to-server communications. In other words: it needs credentials but does not handle how they are acquired.

First, you'll need to add these dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.okta.spring</groupId>
    <artifactId>okta-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
The main class will also receive a new security configuration:

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.EnableTransactionManagement;

@SpringBootApplication
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class SpringBootPostgressqlApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(SpringBootPostgressqlApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Configuration
    static class OktaOAuth2WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

        @Override
        protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
            http
                .authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
                .oauth2ResourceServer().jwt();
        }
    }
}
```

`OktaOAuth2WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` defines our configuration. 

* `.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated()` - tells Spring Security every request **must** be authenticated.
* `.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt()` - configures the application as a Resource Server that will allows access tokens for authorization.

Finally, add two new properties in your `application.properties` file:

```properties
okta.oauth2.issuer=https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
okta.oauth2.clientId={yourClientId}
```

Where `yourOktaDomain` and `yourClientID` are the information provided by Okta's website.

These properties are going to tell Spring and Okta where are the OAuth 2.0 issuer and what is the client ID for this application...

... Issuer, clientId, what am I talking about? To test the application, you need to [create a free-forever account on Okta](https://developer.okta.com/signup/) and set up a few things.

In the Okta dashboard, create an application of type Service it indicates a resource server that does not have a login page or any way to obtain new tokens.

<img src="/img/blog/postgresql-with-spring-boot/create-new-service.png" 
     alt="Create new Service" width="800" class="center-image">

Click **Next**, type the name of your service, then click **Done**. You will be presented with a screen similar to the one below. Copy and paste your _Client ID_ for later. It will be useful when you are starting your application.

<img src="/img/blog/postgresql-with-spring-boot/service-created.png" 
     alt="Service created" width="800" class="center-image">

Now, start your application like before:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Run again `curl` (the `-v` attribute will return the response headers):

```bash
> curl -v http://localhost:8080/courses
< HTTP/1.1 401 
< Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=6AA0A042FB1D69CC1CB9747820FDF5E1; Path=/; HttpOnly
< WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
< X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
< X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
< Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate
< Pragma: no-cache
< Expires: 0
< X-Frame-Options: DENY
< Content-Length: 0
< Date: Thu, 20 Dec 2018 04:46:21 GMT
```

The server returns a 401 HTTP code, which means you are unauthorized. Now, let's create a valid token. An easy way to achieve a token to generate one using [OpenID Connect <debugger/>](https://oidcdebugger.com/).

First, you'll need to create a new Web application in Okta:

<img src="/img/blog/postgresql-with-spring-boot/create-new-web-application.png" 
     alt="New web application" width="800" class="center-image">

Set the _Login redirect URIs_ field to https://oidcdebugger.com/debug and _Grant Type Allowed_ to Hybrid. Click **Done** and copy the client ID for the next step.

Now, on the OpenID Connect website, fill the form in like the picture below (do not forget to fill in the client ID for your recently created Okta web application):

<img src="/img/blog/postgresql-with-spring-boot/openid-connect.png" 
     alt="OpenID connect" width="700" class="center-image">

Submit the form to start the authentication process. You'll receive an Okta login form if you are not logged in or you'll see the screen below with your custom token.

<img src="/img/blog/postgresql-with-spring-boot/openid-connect-token.png" 
     alt="Token from OpenID connect" width="800" class="center-image">

The token will be valid for one hour so you can do a lot of testing with your API. It's simple to use the token, just copy it and modify the curl command to use it as follows:

```bash
export TOKEN={YOUR_TOKEN}
curl -v -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" http://localhost:8080/teachers
```

And it's done!

## Versioning and Securing Database Version Changes

**TIP:** Use `git checkout migration` to skip this section.

Hibernate DDL creation is a nice feature for PoCs or small projects. For more significant projects that have a complex deployment workflow and features like version rollback in case of a significant issue, the solution is not sufficient.

There are several tools to handle database migrations, and one of the most popular is [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/), which works flawlessly with Spring Boot. Briefly, Flyway looks for SQL scripts on your project's resource path and runs all scripts not previously executed in a defined order. Flyway store what files were executed into a particular table called `SCHEMA_VERSION`.

First, add Flyway as a dependency in `pom.xml`. When Spring detects Flyway on the classpath, it will run it on startup:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

By default, Flyway looks at files in the format `V$X__$DESCRIPTION.sql`, where $X is the migration version name, in folder `src/main/resources/db/migration`. Create two files: one for the DDL and another for sample data:

**V1__ddl.sql**
```sql
CREATE TABLE course
  (
     id         UUID NOT NULL,
     NAME       VARCHAR(255),
     rate       INT2 NOT NULL,
     workload   INT4 NOT NULL,
     teacher_id UUID,
     PRIMARY KEY (id)
  );

CREATE TABLE teacher
  (
     id         UUID NOT NULL,
     email      VARCHAR(255),
     NAME       VARCHAR(255),
     pictureurl VARCHAR(255),
     PRIMARY KEY (id)
  );

ALTER TABLE course
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_course_teacher FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES teacher;
```

**V2__data.sql**
```sql
INSERT INTO teacher
            (id,

```

Before starting the project again, delete the class `DataFillerService` since these SQL files will now import all data.

In `application.properties` change the `ddl-auto` configuration to `validate`:

```properties
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate
```

It means Hibernate validates if the Schema matches with what was defined in Java. If no match is found, the application will not startup.

Delete and create a new PostgreSQL database instance, since the first instance was creating using JPA.

```bash
docker rm -f dev-postgres
docker run --name dev-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d postgres:11
docker exec dev-postgres psql -U postgres -c"CREATE DATABASE coursedb" postgres
```

Now, start Spring Boot again:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

You will see the same data exposed, but if you have a look into the logs, will notice Flyway is running database migration:

```

## Scratching NoSQL Surface with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL's JSONB Data Structure

**TIP:** Use `git checkout jsonb` to skip this section.

[NoSQL databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) are, as the name says, databases that do not store their data with relationships. There are many types of NoSQL databases: graph databases, key-value stores, document, etc. Generally speaking, one of the most significant advantages of this kind of database is the lack of schema enforcement (you can mix a different kind of data), different levels of data consistency and better performance in some cases.

PostgreSQL adopted some data types to handle JSON data inside its data structures. This datatype is called JSONB, and this section shows how it is possible to use it with Spring Boot and without changing your current schema.

First, create a new migration file `V3__teacher_reviews.sql`.

```sql
ALTER TABLE teacher
  ADD COLUMN reviews jsonb
```

To properly work with this custom datatype, you need to add a dependency that correctly handles it. Add the following to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.vladmihalcea</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-types-52</artifactId>
    <version>2.3.4</version>
</dependency>
```

The column `reviews` stores a JSON array with all reviews a teacher received. First, you need to change the superclass to define the new datatype correctly:

**EntityWithUUID.java**
```java
import com.vladmihalcea.hibernate.type.json.JsonBinaryType;
import org.hibernate.annotations.Type;
import org.hibernate.annotations.TypeDef;
import org.hibernate.annotations.TypeDefs;

import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.MappedSuperclass;
import java.util.UUID;

@MappedSuperclass
@TypeDefs({
    @TypeDef(name = "jsonb", typeClass = JsonBinaryType.class)
})
public class EntityWithUUID {
    @Id
    @Type(type = "pg-uuid")
    private UUID id;

    public EntityWithUUID() {
        this.id = UUID.randomUUID();
    }
}
```

Now, create a  class called `Review` in the `entities` package:

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities;

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import java.io.Serializable;
import java.time.LocalDate;

@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Review implements Serializable {
    private String author;
    private String review;
    private LocalDate date;
}
```

This class needs to implement `Serializable` as it is stored in JSON format. Now, change `Teacher` class to have a _reviews_ property:

```java
import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;
import lombok.Data;
import lombok.NoArgsConstructor;
import org.hibernate.annotations.Type;

import javax.persistence.Basic;
import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.FetchType;
import java.util.List;

@Entity
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class Teacher extends EntityWithUUID {

    private String name;
    private String pictureURL;
    private String email;

    @Type(type = "jsonb")
    @Column(columnDefinition = "jsonb")
    @Basic(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<Review> reviews;
}
```

Now you have set a list of data type `jsonb` but also added a `fetch = LAZY` property. The property tells Hibernate to **NOT** retrieve the attribute value unless asked. Without the property, every call to a teacher instance will process JSON and create review objects. Hibernate needs a Maven plugin to work with lazy attributes properly. Edit the `pom.xml` file and add the following snippet in the `<plugins>` section.

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.orm.tooling</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-enhance-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>5.4.0.Final</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <configuration>
                <failOnError>true</failOnError>
                <enableLazyInitialization>true</enableLazyInitialization>
            </configuration>
            <goals>
                <goal>enhance</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

OK, you are almost there. You just need to add some methods to add reviews to a teacher. I decided to take a more MVC approach here and create a Service and a Controller.

**TeacherService.java**

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.service;

import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Review;
import javax.validation.constraints.NotNull;

public interface TeacherService {
    /**
     *
     * @param teacherID
     * @param review
     * @throws javax.persistence.EntityNotFoundException
     */
    void addReview(@NotNull String teacherID, @NotNull Review review);
}
```

**SimpleTeacherService.java**

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.service;

import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.dao.TeacherDAO;
import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Review;
import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Teacher;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Isolation;
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional;
import javax.persistence.EntityNotFoundException;
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Objects;
import java.util.UUID;

@Service
public class SimpleTeacherService implements TeacherService {
    private final TeacherDAO teacherDAO;

    public SimpleTeacherService(TeacherDAO teacherDAO) {
        this.teacherDAO = teacherDAO;
    }
    
    @Override
    @Transactional(isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE)
    public void addReview(String teacherID, Review review) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(teacherID);
        Objects.requireNonNull(review);
        Teacher teacher = teacherDAO
                .findById(UUID.fromString(teacherID))
                .orElseThrow(() -> new EntityNotFoundException(teacherID));
        review.setDate(LocalDate.now());
        if(teacher.getReviews() == null){
            teacher.setReviews(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        teacher.getReviews().add(review);
        teacherDAO.save(teacher);
    }
}
```

**TeacherController.java**

```java
package com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.controllers;

import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.entities.Review;
import com.okta.developer.spring_boot_postgressql.service.TeacherService;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import javax.persistence.EntityNotFoundException;

@RestController
public class TeacherController {

    private final TeacherService teacherService;

    public TeacherController(TeacherService teacherService) {
        this.teacherService = teacherService;
    }
    
    @PostMapping("/teachers/{id}/review")
    public ResponseEntity addReview(@RequestBody Review review, @PathVariable("id") String teacherID){
        try {
            teacherService.addReview(teacherID, review);
            return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
        }
        catch (EntityNotFoundException e){
            return ResponseEntity.notFound().build();
        }
    }
}
```

In `SimpleTeacherService`, note that there  is an annotation `@Transactional(isolation = Isolation.SERIALIZABLE)`. It means every call to this method runs in the most secure transaction level. In other words, once the code reads the `reviews` JSON value, no other code can read or write on the `reviews` column (it is blocked) until the transaction finishes. Why's that? Since you are manipulating JSON content, if a concurrent transaction updates the column, one of them will have consistency problems.

You can now start your app:

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Moreover, test the review upload by running CURL:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"\
  http://localhost:8080/teachers/531e4cdd-bb78-4769-a0c7-cb948a9f1238/review \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "author" : "Raphael",
    "review" : "Test"
  }'
```
